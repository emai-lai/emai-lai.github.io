	<h2>My name is Emai. I am a sophomore at Tufts University studying Human Factors Engineering with a focus in UI/UX design, and double minoring in Computer Science and Film and Media Studies. I believe my combination of studies is a unique one, but really, I just like making things: stories, designs, websites, programs... everything!</h2>

	<h2>In addition to my academics, I enjoy performing with Public Harmony and making videos for the Institute Sketch Comedy and Tufts University Television on campus.</h2> 

	<h2>I hope to find a career path in the intersection of all my creative interests.</h2>
